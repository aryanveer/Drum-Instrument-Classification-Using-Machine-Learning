# Drum Instrument Classification Using Machine Learning

1. The main focus of this project is on classification of various Drum sub instruments: Bass Drum, Snare Drum, Toms and Cymbal. The initial input is the audio recordings of the various sub parts of the Drum Kit in WAV file format. 

2. The audio recordings are self-prepared by recording instruments using proper recording equipment in a soundproofed room so as to minimize noise interference. Feature Extraction is then performed on these audio recordings and various features are extracted and are recorded in a tabular format, having rows for each entry and columns for various features. 

3. One of the columns is the Class of the instrument to which it belongs. It is simply an integer mapped to an instrument (making the use of Label Encoder).
